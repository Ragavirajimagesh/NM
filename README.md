Project 1: decoding emotions through sentimental analysis using social media data
📝 Description:
Analyze social media posts or reviews to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral). Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the text and train a sentiment analysis model. Visualize sentiment trends over time or by topic.
Introduction:
This project dives into sentiment analysis, where we'll use social media posts to figure out if people are generally feeling positive, negative, or neutral. We'll use a step-by-step process, from cleaning the data to building and improving machine learning models. We'll also experiment with different techniques and visualizations to understand sentiment trends and hopefully build a tool that can automatically analyze public opinion.
🔧 Project Structure:
🧠 Define the Problem: Understand the objective and type of problem (classification, regression, etc.).
🗂️ data collection: Obtain the dataset, handle missing values, and preprocess data.
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize data to understand patterns and correlations.
📐 Feature Engineering: Select and create relevant features.
🔀 Split the Data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
📈 Evaluate the Model: Use appropriate metrics to evaluate the model on the test set.
🚀 Deploy the Model (optional): Create an application or API to make predictions using the trained model.
